# Assessing the HI-ness of Virtual Heritage applications with Knowledge Engineering

This repository contains materials for the paper titled "Assessing the HI-ness of Virtual Heritage Applications with Knowledge Engineering," which has been accepted for presentation at the Third International Conference on Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence (HHAI 2024). It includes scenarios, task descriptions, and other relevant content.


## Scenario repository
For six VR exhibition scenarios, we provide task decomposition in markdown as well as a visual (flowchart) representation. The task decomposition consists of a *title*, a *description*, and a *visual task decomposition*. The scenarios currently in the repository are listed below:

- [S1](S1/) Multimodal Interactions.
- [S2](S2/) Real-time Understanding of User States.
- [S3](S3/) Memory Integration for Personalization.
- [S4](S4/) Perception Building.
- [S5](S5/) Transparency and Explainability.
- [S6](S6/) Collaborative Pursuit of Goals.
